### Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm leonbee (Furkan)

Has been working with Roblox LuaU and JavaScript/TypeScript for a long time and it's fun to help and present things to people who enjoy them. I'm trying to improve myself in the future.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on [StyLua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua), a Lua code formatter to ease the burden of style review.
- âš¡ I love working on different kinds of software, ranging from command line tools to video games.
